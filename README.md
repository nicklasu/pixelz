# pixelz
A Very simple image manipulation experiment program using Image module from Pillow library.

I am looping the pixels of the image, and moving them / overwriting to create interesting effects.
You can change the image to whatever you want as long as it is one of the listed here:

https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html

I tested jpeg and png.

The images can be saved by right-clicking the opening window or if that doesn't work by copy-pasting to a browser.
Has a few functions to play around with, like blur, pixelization and wild mode (goes crazy).
Feel free to change the values, and see what happens!

Tested only on a Linux machine running popOS (Gnome DE) and pyCharm, so your experience might vary!
